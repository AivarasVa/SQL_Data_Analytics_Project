# 📊 SQL Data Analysis Project

This is my first SQL project where I conducted data analysis using SQL.  
The main focus of this project is on SQL techniques and technical implementation rather than deriving business insights.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Download the repository, **including the `datasets` folder**.
2. In the `00_init_database.sql` file, **update the file path locations** to point to where your `datasets` folder is stored.
3. Run the initialization script to create the database: `00_init_database.sql`.
4. After the database is created, run the remaining SQL scripts to perform the analysis.
